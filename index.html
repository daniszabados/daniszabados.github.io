            <h1>Paprikas Csirke</h1>
            <h3><i>History</i></h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_paprikash" target="_blank" class="food-link"><b><u>Paprikas Csirke </u></b></a>originated from Hungary. It translates to<i>"Chicken Paprikash"</i>. Paprika is a Hungairan spice and is considered the most unique part of the dish. "Paprika" is the Hungarian word for pepper. Hungarian-style Paprika is not smoked, however it has a very sweet taste.</p>
            <p>Although a huge part of the dish is the Paprika, the origins of the dish predate the introduction of Paprika. The dish can be traced back to a one-pot chicken stew favored by Hungarians that were considered lower class. The dish dates back to 18th or 19th century. My mom makes Paprikas Csirke all the time and it is one of my favorite dishes. My grandpa also used to love eating it.</p>

                <p class="description">Chicken Paprikash is considered the most beloved Hungarian dish. It is considered a Hungarian comfort food that can be made fairly quickly. Chicken Paprikash is very tasty which is mainly because of the rich paprika sauce that is made with it.</p>

            <h3><i>Recipe</i></h3>
            <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons pork lard or butter</li>
                <li>3 pounds chicken pieces bone-in and skin-on</li>
                <li>2 medium yellow onions, very finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
                <li>2 Roma tomatoes, seeds removed and very finely diced</li>
                <li>1 Hungarian bell pepper</li>
                <li>3-4 tablespoons paprika</li>
                <li>2 cups Aneto 100% All-Natural Chicken Broth</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup full fat sour cream (room temperature)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><u>Instructions</u></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the lard in a heavy pot and brown the chicken on all sides.  Transfer the chicken to a plate.  In the same oil, add the onions and fry until golden brown.  Add the garlic and tomatoes (and pepper if using) and fry another 2-3 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the paprika, salt and pepper (paprika becomes bitter if scorched).  </li>
                <li>Return the chicken to the pot and place it back over the heat.  Pour in the chicken broth. The chicken should be mostly covered. Bring it to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 40 minutes. Remove the chicken and transfer to a plate.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, stir the flour into the sour cream/cream mixture to form a smooth paste. Stir the cream mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring it to a simmer for a couple of minutes until the sauce is thickened. Add salt and pepper to taste. Return the chicken to the sauce and simmer to heat through.</li>
                <li>Serve the chicken paprikash with Hungarian nokedli, which is like German Spaetzle only they're very short and stubby.  You can make nokedli with a spätzle scraper and using this recipe for the dough.  </li>
            </ol>
